# Core-5e

Welcome to Core-5e! This project is dedicated to providing a structured and organized approach to utilizing the System Reference Document 5.1 (SRD 5.1), originally developed by Wizards of the Coast LLC, now available at [https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document).

## Purpose

The primary goal of Core-5e is to offer a logical division and categorization of the SRD 5.1 content, making it easier for developers and users to navigate and integrate these materials into their projects in a coherent manner. By focusing on clear structure and organization, we aim to facilitate learning, development, and innovation within the Dungeons & Dragons community.
