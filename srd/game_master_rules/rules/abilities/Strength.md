Strength, the very essence of bodily power and athletic prowess, measures one's capacity to exert raw physical force. It encompasses the endurance of a seasoned warrior, the might of a heroic champion, and the sheer determination required to overcome the most formidable challenges.

#### **Strength Checks**

A Strength check represents any endeavor that involves lifting, pushing, pulling, or breaking something, forcing your way through tight spaces, or applying brute force to overcome an obstacle. The Athletics skill, a subset of Strength, specifically covers situations requiring physical endurance and control in climbing, jumping, or swimming.

**Athletics**

Your Strength (Athletics) check is called upon in demanding scenarios where physical ability is crucial:

- **Climbing**: Scaling a sheer or slippery cliff, avoiding hazards while ascending, or clinging to a surface against a force trying to dislodge you.
- **Jumping**: Attempting an unusually long jump or performing stunts mid-air.
- **Swimming**: Battling treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or thick seaweed, or resisting another creature's attempts to pull you underwater.

**Other Strength Checks**

Beyond Athletics, the GM may require a Strength check for various physical feats:

- Forcing open a stuck, locked, or barred door.
- Breaking free from restraints.
- Pushing through a narrow tunnel.
- Holding onto a wagon while being dragged.
- Tipping over a heavy statue.
- Preventing a boulder from rolling down a hill.

#### **Attack Rolls and Damage**

Strength not only defines your physical might but also enhances your combat effectiveness. When wielding a melee weapon—be it a mace, battleaxe, or javelin—you add your Strength modifier to both your attack roll and damage roll. Melee weapons are your tools in hand-to-hand combat, and many can also be thrown for ranged attacks.

#### **Lifting and Carrying**

Your Strength score dictates how much weight you can bear, influencing your carrying capacity and ability to push, drag, or lift heavy loads.

**Carrying Capacity**

Your carrying capacity is determined by multiplying your Strength score by 15. This total, in pounds, represents the maximum weight you can carry without being encumbered, allowing most characters to operate without constant concern for their load.

**Push, Drag, or Lift**

You can push, drag, or lift up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). However, moving weight beyond your carrying capacity reduces your speed to a mere 5 feet per round.

**Size and Strength**

The carrying capacity scales with the creature's size. Larger creatures can bear more weight, with each size category above Medium doubling their carrying capacity and the amount they can push, drag, or lift. Conversely, Tiny creatures can carry only half the weight a Medium creature can.

## Variant: Encumbrance 
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
